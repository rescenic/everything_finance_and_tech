//! An implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. The algorithm finds the shortest path between
//! a starting node and all other nodes in the graph. The algorithm also detects negative cycles.
//! If a node is part of a negative cycle then the minimum cost for that node is set to
//! `f64::NEG_INFINITY`
